1. Remove request/approval functionality from Branch9 (https://github.com/felipeabajo/ClasesdeskatecomBlazorServer). Comment every reference to Approved/Unapproved Firstname/Lastname. Revert changes in ApplicationUser. Comment every reference to Requests. Bind SfText to user."Properties". Remove variables for properties.
2. Check publicProfile availability on filling the last missing required field (it should become available) without having to refresh the page. Add logic that sets publicProfile to false if any of the requirements is not met. How to do it? I could do it directly on AreRequiredFieldsRequestFilled, in case false,  user.PublicProfile = false. UpdateContext(user).
3. Clean-up in PersonalInformation: remove commented code, remove username,remove functionality other than updating user for lastname, remove call this.OnAfterRenderAsync(true) for firstname and lastname, remove teacherNeverPublicAlert.Refresh(); in every reference except PublicProfileValueChangeHandler. Change alignment of formfields.
4. Clean-up comments. Catch up implementation in Image.
5. Remove UploadStart Event for Setting userId (done with BeforeUpload).
6. Clean-up IsUserImagePathURLNull in ImagePersonalController. Comment references to requests in PersonalInformation.
7. Change name of changeInRequiredFields and areRequiredFieldsFilled for variable and methods.
8. Restore IsUserImagePathURLNull method in ImagePersonalController (since in reality it's used).
9. Info icon por price per hour.
10. Check behaviour when a user removes information from Personal Information. There're probably better UX than this, but for now, it's allowed to remove it, making sure that if the fields are empty, behaviouris as null. Check no longer happening: problem with firstname Field on Edge only, that when focus out (spotted when focused via mouse), it appears a strange shadow. I think it has to do with the box with the suggestions.
11. Change place of info-icon for image (now it's hidden and only displayed if user edits). Included as plain text in Dialog template and icon without hover functionality.
12. NET SDK's Secret Manager tool setup. Secure keys in appsetting with Azure KeyVault. In Project setup - Blazor Server Azure there's a reference to AKV in section Stripe, which is before the next reference to AKV in Keyvault setup section. IDK if I should start by enabling Remote debug (immediatelly before Keyvault Setup) on Azure App Service or I should restore Services/IAKV Service and reference in program.cs. I take a look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czh9cGLVRNA (I used this I think). I think this video tutorial is more complex than what I need. I launch portal.azure.com with my info@felipeabajo.com account for checking billing and status. Try to create a free Azure account. I am not eligible for free account. I create account as new customer (New customers are those who have not previously had an Azure 
account and received 12 months of free services.) I start here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/on-net/secretless-apps-with-net-and-azure-key-vault. SmtpSettings.Password = null in appsettings. Open Secrets manager by right clicking on project and Manage Secrets Manager. Create the JSON object writing the key that was set to null. It does not need any additional config.
13. Feedback for emails sent through Help page added.
14. Add email format constraint to ToEmail in MailRequest. Tried to replicate what there is in InputModel of Register.cshtml.cs [EmailAddress]and the same structure I used for Price of ApplicationUser. It does not show anything, either with or without applying Migration.  I also try putting [Required] [EmailAddress] [Display(Name = "Email")] and the same,
it does not show anything, either with or without applying Migration. 
I try also including [DataType(DataType.EmailAddress)] and [EmailAddress (ErrorMessage = "Invalid email address")]. None of them work.  Fxck. It was because of DataAnnotationsValidator. I am not sure whether migration is required or not, just in case, I apply it. The behaviour is strange, it seems that the message it only appears when the user types and then deletes. Change hide class for hide-message and moved to site.css. Functionality for enabling/disabling Send button added. Add required constraint to every field of MailRequest.
15. InformationMessage and WarningMessage removed since they are not working properly (Enter key input on AutoComplete makes them disappear). TeacherProfileRequestAlert removed. TeacherProfileRequest functionality removed.
16. Review everything that is not used in PersonalInformation.
17. If [Required] is not declared in ApplicationUser, the green appears when Firstname is not null, even though is empty. If [Required] is declared in ApplicationUser, the green appears when Firstname is a non empty string, without migration being required. Fix colors of form fields (e-success class) by using Data Annotations (Required) for fields that are either visible only to teachers or required for both roles. When applied to a field that is null, I get an error suggesting to use IsDBNull, error is fixed by removing the ?, standing for nullable, in the fields. This does not work for the register process of new users. I try to include Firstname in the process of registering a new user, even though, there's no field for Firstname, by including an empty string to Firstname, but the process does not work. When registering the user, the screen just refreshes, removing password and that's all (the problem is adding [Required] to firstname in InputModel and not entering information for that field). If I include nullable to the property of ApplicationUser, the registration process works, then I guess the problem of register process not working is due to whether nullable is declared or not, rather than the usage of DataAnnotations. Then I infere that, to avoid the first exception (IsDBNull) I need the fields not being null, in this case, the cause it is the [Required]. I change Null for an empty string directly in DB and it works. And now, when there're some chars is green, when there are no chars is red.
18. Required added also to Province, Speciality and Price. The only problem (little) that I see has to do with the range of numbers. Even though I put 0 in Register.cshtml.cs automatically gets 1 as a value. I change it to 1 and continue.
19. Fix every await that is suggested in Personal Information. Error about [Required] implementation. Add-Migration and it seems to be fixed.
20. Improve system for gathering Provinces and Specialities. Requirements: provinces and specialities available for editing Personal Information and also for searching teachers. Solution: (simplest I can figure out) put that info into separate classes, using public static list for gathering elements.
21. Province and Speciality refered to common classes in Teacher Search page.
